The Developer Open Space is not a typical developer conference: There are __no__ fixed speakers or topics, just many other tech lovers who wants to __learn__ or __share__ __their__ knowledge. 

The Open Space was started in 2009 and was more or less Microsoft-centric, but times are changing and the technology discussions on previous Open Spaces spread to all different kinds of technology - from fancy Web, to DevOps, Functional Programming, IoT etc. 

But it is not just technology: If you want to talk about Soft-Skills or want to hear how other developers do their jobs just join the Developer Open Space.
Even if you want to talk about how you craft your own beer: I bet you will find your audience ;)

Sounds good, right? Just visit the __[official website](https://devopenspace.de/)__ for more information. I will be there from Saturday to Sunday :)
