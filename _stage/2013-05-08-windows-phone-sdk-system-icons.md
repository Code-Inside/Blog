Although the Metro Design focuses a lot on Typography Icons are still quite important. If you install Windows Phone SDK you will receive 36 Icons. You can find them here:

<em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v8.0\Icons</em>

Unfortunately many Icons you might know from the common applications are not integrated. <a href="http://www.pedrolamas.com/">Pedro Lamas</a> extracted 99 additional Icons from the App-Resources and offers them <a href="http://www.pedrolamas.com/windows-phone/windows-phone-8-application-bar-icons/">as a download</a>.
