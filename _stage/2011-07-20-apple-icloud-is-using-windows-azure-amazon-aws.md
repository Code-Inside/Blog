On Twitter I’ve found a very interesting story: <a href="http://www.infiniteapple.net/is-icloud-utilizing-microsoft-azure-and-amazons-cloud-services/">Apples iCloud is using Windows Azure and Amazon AWS</a>. A iOS5 Beta User was able to tape-record the Traffic with the help of a Proxy while he was sending a picture on a iMessage service. Amazon AWS and the Blob Storage of Windows Azure were named as data source for up- and download. <a href="http://www.infiniteapple.net/is-icloud-utilizing-microsoft-azure-and-amazons-cloud-services/">(Here you can see a screenshot from the Sniffers</a>)

It’s not clear if the usage was only temporary (in fact Apple has built <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/apple-launches-icloud-heres-what-powers-it/">his own huge data center</a>) or if the files lay there only as a cache and Amazon and Azure only worked as CDN.

Kind of ironical that Apple is using Microsoft services but on the other hand it’s a great opportunity and reference for the Windows Azure Team. Same thing for Amazon.
