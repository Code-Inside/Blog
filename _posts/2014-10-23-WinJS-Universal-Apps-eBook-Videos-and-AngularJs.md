With the "new" Universal Apps and the outlook of a single platform with Windows 10 I'm still not happy with the combination of XAML and C#. The problem is not C# - just let me say that I'm not a huge fan of XAML. So lets see how WinJS might work. Microsoft published a free eBook recently about WinJS and I found some other interesting videos. 

## Free ebook: Programming Windows Store Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Second Edition

The eBook is available on the [__Microsoft Virtual Academy as a simple PDF__](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2014/04/08/free-ebook-programming-windows-store-apps-with-html-css-and-javascript-second-edition.aspx)
 - no signup required.
 
## Channel 9 Serie

There are 2 episodes about WinJS development on [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Defrag-Tools/Defrag-Tools-111-Programming-Windows-Store-Apps-with-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript-Part-1)

## Build 2014: WinJS and Windows Phone

This session [__"What's new in WinJS: The Road ahead"__](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-506) was in the Build 2014 lineup and shows how you can use WinJS in Windows Phone Apps (as Univeral App I guess) and the current roadmap.

## Using WinJS with Angular.js?

You can't talk about Javascript Apps without mentioning Angular.js. The Javascript Engine running your JS App on Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8.1 has some limitations based on security reasons. As far as I know you can't use the pure Angular.js in Windows Store Apps, but there is a [__project on GitHub__](https://github.com/codemonkeychris/angular-winjs) to smooth the experience. 

Also Iris Classon [__blogged about a demo app with WinRT components, Angular.js and WinJS on Windows Phone 8.1__](http://irisclasson.com/2014/06/03/windows-phone-8-1-with-winjs-angular-js-using-a-winrt-component-in-c-cross-language-component/).
