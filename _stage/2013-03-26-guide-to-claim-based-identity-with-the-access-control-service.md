Microsoft published a free PDF about Claim-based Identity, Access Control Service and how to connect it to the remaining Microsoft world (Sharepoint, ADFS, Azure):

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=28362">Download-Link</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff423674.aspx">MSDN Link</a>

I found the announcement today on the <a href="http://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2013/03/18/now-on-amazon-a-guide-to-claims-based-identity-and-access-control-2nd-edition/">blog of Vittorio Bertocci</a>.

<strong>More information’s?</strong>

<strong> </strong>

If you want to get deeper into the subject you should risk a look on <a href="http://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/2013/03/18/now-on-amazon-a-guide-to-claims-based-identity-and-access-control-2nd-edition/">Vittorios Blog</a>. You may be also interested in his <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Patterns-Practices-Symposium-Online/pattern-practices-symposium-2013/Windows-Azure-Active-Directory">Video about Windows Azure Active Directory</a>.

<strong>From SAML to JWT</strong>

<strong> </strong>

What is not included in the PDF but might become a trend anyway is the renunciation from SAML and to <a href="http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html">JWT</a>. I recommend <a href="http://www.cloudidentity.com/blog/?s=JWT">Vittorios Blog</a> again and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj573266.aspx">Windows Azure Authentication Library</a>.

Unfortunately there are not so many sources for information’s about this at the moment so you won’t be able to avoid his blog anyway <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://code-inside.de/blog-in/wp-content/uploads/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile51.png" alt="Zwinkerndes Smiley" />
