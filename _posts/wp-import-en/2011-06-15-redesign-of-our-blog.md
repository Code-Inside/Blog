  <p>After more than 4 years we decided to redesign our blog. The under construction is still WordPress. With the new Design we try to become more “cleaner” (lots of things get the chop of the sidebar) with an individual optic.</p>  <p>A special thanks goes to <a href="http://peggy-reuter.net/">Peggy and Armin Reuter</a> from XAMLFab which helped us a lot to find a fitting Theme and Design. </p>  <p>Most of the Content is already migrated but eventually I’ve lost some Comments because I’ve already copied the SQL Dump – I didn’t act in bad faith ;). </p>  <p>If you would like to give us some feedback or suggestions about the new design you are welcome to do this on the comments below or on our <a href="https://codeinside.uservoice.com/forums/55132-general">UserVoice Side</a>. We promise to publish some more articles soon.</p>
