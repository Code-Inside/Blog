To be fair: [Microsoft Build 2021](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHgMGEnTzEEfkADbaG8aAWRp) was some month ago, but the content might still be relevant today. Sooo... it took me a while, but here is a list of sessions that I found interesting. Some sessions are "better" and some "lighter", the order doesn't reflect that - that was just the order I watched those videos.
 
The headline has a link to the video and below are some notes.
